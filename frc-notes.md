Income
2.12 The definition of income encompasses both revenue and gains.
(a) Revenue is income that arises in the course of the ordinary activities of a
micro-entity and is referred to by a variety of names including sales, fees, interest,
dividends, royalties and rent.
(b) Gains are other items that meet the definition of income but are not revenue.
Expenses
2.13 The definition of expenses encompasses losses as well as those expenses that arise in
the course of the ordinary activities of the micro-entity.
(a) Expenses that arise in the course of the ordinary activities of the micro-entity
include, for example, cost of sales, wages and depreciation. They usually take
the form of an outflow or depletion of assets such as cash, inventory, or property,
plant and equipment.
(b) Losses are other items that meet the definition of expenses and may arise in the
course of the ordinary activities of the micro-entity

Accrual basis
2.21 A micro-entity shall prepare its financial statements using the accrual basis of
accounting. On the accrual basis, items are recognised as assets, liabilities, equity,
income or expenses when they satisfy the definitions and recognition criteria for those
items.

Recognition in financial statements
Assets
2.22 A micro-entity shall recognise an asset in the statement of financial position when it is
probable that the future economic benefits will flow to the micro-entity and the asset has
a cost or value that can be measured reliably. An asset is not recognised in the
statement of financial position when expenditure has been incurred for which it is
considered not probable that economic benefits will flow to the micro-entity beyond the
current reporting period. Instead such a transaction results in the recognition of an
expense in the income statement.
2.23 A micro-entity shall not recognise a contingent asset as an asset. When the flow of
future economic benefits to the micro-entity is virtually certain, then the related asset is
not a contingent asset, and its recognition is appropriate.
Liabilities
2.24 A micro-entity shall recognise a liability in the statement of financial position when:
(a) the micro-entity has an obligation at the end of the reporting period as a result of a
past event;
(b) it is probable that the micro-entity will be required to transfer resources embodying
economic benefits in settlement; and
(c) the settlement amount can be measured reliably.
2.25 A contingent liability is either a possible but uncertain obligation or a present
obligation that is not recognised because it fails to meet one or both of the
conditions (b) and (c) in paragraph 2.24.
Income
2.26 The recognition of income results directly from the recognition and measurement of
assets and liabilities. A micro-entity shall recognise income in the income statement
when an increase in future economic benefits related to an increase in an asset or a
decrease of a liability has arisen that can be measured reliably.
Expenses
2.27 The recognition of expenses results directly from the recognition and measurement of
assets and liabilities. A micro-entity shall recognise expenses in the income statement
when a decrease in future economic benefits related to a decrease in an asset or an
increase of a liability has arisen that can be measured reliably.
Profit or loss
2.28 Profit or loss is the arithmetical difference between income and expenses. It is not a
separate element of financial statements, and a separate recognition principle is not
needed for it.

2.29 Generally this FRS does not allow the recognition of items in the statement of financial
position that do not meet the definition of assets or of liabilities regardless of whether
they result from applying the notion commonly referred to as the ‘matching concept’ for
measuring profit or loss.
