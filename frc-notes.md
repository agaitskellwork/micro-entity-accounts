Income
2.12 The definition of income encompasses both revenue and gains.
(a) Revenue is income that arises in the course of the ordinary activities of a
micro-entity and is referred to by a variety of names including sales, fees, interest,
dividends, royalties and rent.
(b) Gains are other items that meet the definition of income but are not revenue.
Expenses
2.13 The definition of expenses encompasses losses as well as those expenses that arise in
the course of the ordinary activities of the micro-entity.
(a) Expenses that arise in the course of the ordinary activities of the micro-entity
include, for example, cost of sales, wages and depreciation. They usually take
the form of an outflow or depletion of assets such as cash, inventory, or property,
plant and equipment.
(b) Losses are other items that meet the definition of expenses and may arise in the
course of the ordinary activities of the micro-entity

Accrual basis
2.21 A micro-entity shall prepare its financial statements using the accrual basis of
accounting. On the accrual basis, items are recognised as assets, liabilities, equity,
income or expenses when they satisfy the definitions and recognition criteria for those
items.

Recognition in financial statements
Assets
2.22 A micro-entity shall recognise an asset in the statement of financial position when it is
probable that the future economic benefits will flow to the micro-entity and the asset has
a cost or value that can be measured reliably. An asset is not recognised in the
statement of financial position when expenditure has been incurred for which it is
considered not probable that economic benefits will flow to the micro-entity beyond the
current reporting period. Instead such a transaction results in the recognition of an
expense in the income statement.
2.23 A micro-entity shall not recognise a contingent asset as an asset. When the flow of
future economic benefits to the micro-entity is virtually certain, then the related asset is
not a contingent asset, and its recognition is appropriate.
Liabilities
2.24 A micro-entity shall recognise a liability in the statement of financial position when:
(a) the micro-entity has an obligation at the end of the reporting period as a result of a
past event;
(b) it is probable that the micro-entity will be required to transfer resources embodying
economic benefits in settlement; and
(c) the settlement amount can be measured reliably.
2.25 A contingent liability is either a possible but uncertain obligation or a present
obligation that is not recognised because it fails to meet one or both of the
conditions (b) and (c) in paragraph 2.24.
Income
2.26 The recognition of income results directly from the recognition and measurement of
assets and liabilities. A micro-entity shall recognise income in the income statement
when an increase in future economic benefits related to an increase in an asset or a
decrease of a liability has arisen that can be measured reliably.
Expenses
2.27 The recognition of expenses results directly from the recognition and measurement of
assets and liabilities. A micro-entity shall recognise expenses in the income statement
when a decrease in future economic benefits related to a decrease in an asset or an
increase of a liability has arisen that can be measured reliably.
Profit or loss
2.28 Profit or loss is the arithmetical difference between income and expenses. It is not a
separate element of financial statements, and a separate recognition principle is not
needed for it.

2.29 Generally this FRS does not allow the recognition of items in the statement of financial
position that do not meet the definition of assets or of liabilities regardless of whether
they result from applying the notion commonly referred to as the ‘matching concept’ for
measuring profit or loss.


Presumed true and fair view
3.2 The financial statements of a micro-entity that comply with this FRS are presumed in
law to give a true and fair view of the financial position and profit or loss of the
micro-entity in accordance with the micro-entities regime.

Comparative information
3.7 Except when this FRS permits or requires otherwise, a micro-entity shall present
comparative information in respect of the preceding period for all amounts presented in
the current period’s financial statements.

Complete set of financial statements
3.9 A complete set of financial statements of a micro-entity shall include the following:
(a) a statement of financial position as at the reporting date with notes included at
the foot of the statement3
; and
(b) an income statement for the reporting period.
3.10 Because paragraph 3.7 requires comparative amounts in respect of the previous
period for all amounts presented in the financial statements, a complete set of financial
statements means that a micro-entity shall present, as a minimum, two of each of the
required financial statements and related notes.
3.11 In a complete set of financial statements, a micro-entity shall present each financial
statement with equal prominence.
3.12 A micro-entity may use titles for the financial statements other than those used in this
FRS as long as they are not misleading.

Identification of the financial statements
3.13 A micro-entity shall clearly identify each of the financial statements and the notes. In
addition, a micro-entity shall display the following information prominently, and repeat it
when necessary for an understanding of the information presented:
(a) the name of the reporting entity and any change in its name since the end of the
preceding reporting period;
(b) the date of the end of the reporting period and the period covered by the financial
statements;
(c) the presentation currency; and
(d) the level of rounding, if any, used in presenting amounts in the financial
statements.
3.13A In accordance with section 396(A1) of the Act, the financial statements of a
micro-entity in the UK shall state:
(a) the part of the United Kingdom in which the micro-entity is registered;
(b) the micro-entity’s registered number;
(c) whether the micro-entity is a public or private company and whether it is limited by
shares or by guarantee

(d) the address of the micro-entity’s registered office; and
(e) where appropriate, the fact that the micro-entity is being wound up.

Statement of compliance with the micro-entity provisions
3.14 Financial statements prepared in accordance with the micro-entity provisions shall
contain on the statement of financial position, in a prominent position above the
signature, a statement that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with
the micro-entity provisions5
.

Section 4

financial position and how to present it. The statement of financial position (which is
referred to as the balance sheet in the Act) presents a micro-entity’s assets,
liabilities and equity as at the end of the reporting period.
4.2 A micro-entity is permitted, but not required, to present information additional to that
required by this section. Paragraph 1.3 applies to any additional information presented.
Information to be presented in the statement of financial position
4.3 A micro-entity shall present a statement of financial position in accordance with one of
the formats set out in Section C of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the Small Companies

Section 5

5.1 A micro-entity shall present its profit or loss for a period, ie its financial performance
for the period. This section sets out the information that shall be presented in the
income statement (which is referred to as the profit and loss account in the Act) and
how to present it.
5.2 A micro-entity is permitted, but not required, to present information additional to that
required by this section. Paragraph 1.3 applies to any additional information presented.
Presentation of profit or loss
5.3 A micro-entity shall present its profit or loss for a period in an income statement in
accordance with Section C of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the Small Companies

5.4 An entity shall recognise all items of income and expense in a period in profit or loss
unless an FRS requires or permits otherwise, or unless prohibited by the Act. For
example, under this FRS, the effects of corrections of material errors and changes in
accounting policies are presented as retrospective adjustments of prior periods
rather than as part of profit or loss in the period in which they arise (see Section 8
Accounting Policies, Estimates and Errors).
